# TODO for Projects Responsiveness

- [x] Add responsive media queries to Projects.css with custom classes for title, button, container, and links, using the same 6 breakpoints as Header.css and Menu.css.
- [x] Update Projects.jsx to apply the new custom classes to the relevant elements (h1, button, container div, h3 links).
- [x] Verify the responsiveness by checking the CSS and JSX for consistency.
